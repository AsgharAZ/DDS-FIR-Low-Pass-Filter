## Implementing Direct Digital Synthesizer & Low-Pass Filter on Verilog with the help of Matlab

This repository contains the code and documentation for a digital system design project implemented using MATLAB and Verilog. The project focuses on designing and implementing a FIR (Finite Impulse Response) Low Pass Filter (LPF) within the context of a Digital Signal Synthesizer (DDS).

### Overview

The project involves the following components:

- **System Architecture**: The architecture of the digital system, including the data path, control path, and top-level system design.
  
- **Filter Design in MATLAB**: Designing a FIR LPF using MATLAB's Filter Designer tool, specifying frequency requirements and obtaining filter coefficients.

- **Filter Implementation in Verilog**: Implementing the FIR LPF in Verilog, integrating it into the larger DDS system architecture.

- **Verification and Simulation**: Validating the Verilog implementation through simulation and comparing results with MATLAB's ideal plots.

### Usage

To reproduce the results or run simulations:

1. Navigate to the relevant directories (`Source Code/`).
2. You can follow the instructions in the provided documents/reports in this repository.
3. Execute the scripts or commands as instructed to run simulations, generate plots, or analyze results.
